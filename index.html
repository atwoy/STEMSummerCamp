    <h1>Plot</h1>
    <p>In Astoria, Oregon, a group of kids called "The Goonies," want to go on a final adventure before their homes are foreclosed due to an expanding country club. The main characters are Michael "Mikey" Walsh, an optimist, his big brother, Brandon "Brand" Walsh, and his friends: a talkative kid named Clark "Mouth" Deveraux, an invetoer named Richard "Data" Wang, and an overweight klutz named and Lawrence "Chunk" Cohen. They find lots of cool stuff in the Walshes' attic, including an old treasure map, which leads to "One-Eyed" Willy's pirate ship and they want to find the treasure. The four friends manage to tie Brand to an armchair, while they go try and get the treasure, but instead, they're led to a rundown restaurant. At the restaurant, they encounter the Fratellis, a criminal family using the restaurant as their hideout. Eventually, Mikey, Data, Mouth, and Chunk are caught by Brand and two girls: Andy, a popular cheerleader who has a crush on Brand, who shares the same feelings for her, and Stef, a nerdy, tough-talking girl and Andy's best friend.

    <p>Brand suggests to Mikey and his friends that they should go home, but they want to find the treasure. The group then discovers that the Fratellis are using the restaurant as their hideout. Just as the Fratellis return to their hideout, the kids find a tunnel underground and Mikey, Brand, Data, Mouth, Andy, and Stef hide in there while Chunk gets the police. While exploring the tunnel, Mikey, Brand, Data, Mouth, Andy, and Stef find the remains of a former treasure explorer, who also searched for treasure, and Mikey ensures that they're going the right way. While avoiding many booby traps that were set by Willy, they find themselves under an old wishing well. Mikey and his friends have the chance to be pulled up by Andy's obnoxious boyfriend, Troy Perkins, whose family owns the country club, but they are convinced by Mikey to continue the journey. Meanwhile, Chunk makes his way to the police station, but in the process, he is caught by the Fratellis and they threaten him by tempting to shred his hands with an active blender, and he confesses to the Fratellis by telling them bad things he did that aren't true. The Fratellis then tie Chunk to a chair and lock him in the basement next to their deformed younger brother, Sloth, who is chained to the wall watching TV. Although Chunk is scared by the way Sloth looks at first, Chunk discoveres that he's actually a nice guy and the two become friends. Sloth then breaks their chains and they head into the tunnel.

    <p>Meanwhile, Mikey, Brand, Data, Mouth, Andy, and Stef discover that the Fratellis are right behind them and the Goonies encounter more obstacles and nearly die along the way. Eventually, they find Willy's pirate ship and they find a motherlode of treasure onboard. Mikey then names Willy as the first "Goonie." Then Mikey and his friends fill their pockets with the treasure. Unfortunately, the Fratellis caught up with them and they force Mikey and his friends to drop the treasure and then they threaten to kill them by making Andy walk the plank. As Andy and Brand are thrown off of the boat, Chunk and Sloth appear. Sloth is furious about how his family mistreated him in the past, and easily defeats them and he helps the Goonies to escape the boat. Mikey wants to go back for the treasure, but Brand worries for their lives, and they escape through a hole in the grotto and eventually arrive on a nearby beach shore. The police quickly come to their rescue and reunite them with their families.

    <p>The Fratellis free themselves and start looting the boat. When they take the coins that Mikey had left earlier, they trip another booby trap that causes the grotto to start to cave in. They're then forced to abandon the loot and flee to the beach, where the police quickly take them into custody. The Goonies are then being taken care of their families and Chunk welcomes Sloth into his family. Eventually, the country club owners arrive at the scene and order Mr. Walsh to sign the foreclosure papers. Just as he is about to sign, Rosalita, the housekeeper, finds gems in Mikey's marble bag that the Fratellis forgot to check and tells Mr. Walsh not to sign the papers, because the gems are more than enough to negate the foreclosure. With that, Mr. Walsh tears up the papers into pieces and throws the pieces in the air for celebration. As the Goonies and their families celebrate, newscasters ask them about their adventure and the Goonies tell them all about it. Then, the attention of everybody on the beach is caught by the sight of the unmanned Inferno, now clear of the grotto. The Goonies cheers and wave goodbye to the ship as it sets off at full sail into the sunset.
